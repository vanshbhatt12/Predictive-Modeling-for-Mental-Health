# Predictive-Modeling-for-Mental-Health
The project commenced with the collection of a mental health-related dataset sourced from Kaggle. Subsequently, rigorous preprocessing steps were undertaken, encompassing tasks such as managing missing values, standardizing features, and employing the Rank Correlation method to encode categorical variables. Furthermore, the dataset was partitioned into training, validation, and test sets to facilitate model training and evaluation. Moving forward, the architecture of the neural network was meticulously designed, consisting of one input layer, five hidden layers, and one output layer. The number of neurons in each layer, including input and output layers, was determined to optimize model performance. Activation functions for all layers were set as ReLU to introduce non-linearity. Following the architectural design, the model was initialized using a sequential model object through TensorFlow or Keras. Subsequent layers were added to the model utilizing the add() method, specifying respective layer types and parameters. Compilation of the model entailed specifying the loss function, tailored to the classification problem at hand, and selecting the Nadam optimizer algorithm to minimize loss during training. With the model prepared, training commenced by feeding the training data into the model using the fit() method. Specifications included 10 epochs for iterations over the entire dataset and a batch size of 16 samples per gradient update. Monitoring of the model's performance on the validation data was undertaken throughout training to detect potential overfitting. Upon completion of training, evaluation of the model's performance on the test dataset ensued, employing pertinent evaluation metrics such as accuracy and the r squared value. Discrepancies between training and test performance were scrutinized to glean insights into the model's generalization capabilities.
